# yt-song
A silly litte Bash script that I threw together forever ago. tt basically downloads a music video via yt-dlp, converts it into .mp3 with ffmpeg, then fills in the exif data for the track with user input and puts the file in your ~/Music folder. Pairs well with cmus, enjoy! 

dependencies (obviously) include yt-dlp, ffmpeg, and id3v2
